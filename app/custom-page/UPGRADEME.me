# `app/custom-page/` upgrade notes

- Keep the component as a client component if it needs access to `window` or `window.openai` in future iterations.
- When adjusting styling, ensure Tailwind classes you use exist in the current Tailwind version configured in `globals.css`.
- If you add additional navigation targets, verify they resolve correctly within the App Router and do not bypass the iframe-safe link handling set up in `layout.tsx`.
